          <p className="smaller">Forestry researchers work to better understand the dynamics that shape
            forests around the globe.  However, the process of censusing trees in forest plots is currently
            inefficient and inaccurate. Researchers must manually record metrics on each tree and then transfer
            this data onto the computer in the lab.  This process is tedious and leaves room for error in data collection and input.
